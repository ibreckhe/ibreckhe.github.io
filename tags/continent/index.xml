      <description>Millions of herbarium specimens collected over the past two centuries provide unique insights into continental-scale patterns of plant diversity. With my colleagues Daniel Park, Aaron Ellison, and Charles Davis at Harvard University, we have developed an approach to crowd-source reproductive phenology data collection from digitized specimens. Our initial work resulted in recording buds, flowers, and fruits from ~10,000 specimens of 30 plant species. We have used the data to estimate continental-scale patterns of plant reproductive phenology, revealing a surprising amount of variation in plant responses to climate across regions.</description>

      <description>For decades, scientists have used the seasonal timing of events like flowering to track the impacts of climate change. As these impacts accelerate, it’s becoming more and more important to understand where changes in climate are having the most severe impacts on ecosystems. Tracking flowering can help us understand how climate change is altering the risks of extreme climate events like growing season frost and drought.
In the past few years, new machine-learning approaches (“deep learning”) have finally made it possible to trawl the web for observations of specific species in specific places.</description>
