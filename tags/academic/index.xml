      <description>As of November 2017, I&amp;rsquo;ll be officially starting my new NSF-supported postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology  at Harvard University. I&amp;rsquo;ll be based out of Harvard University Herbaria, where I&amp;rsquo;ll be associated with the lab of Charles C. Davis. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the lab unofficially for almost a year, but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to finally be official!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my seasonal snow melt forecasts for Mt. Rainier National Park to reflect the latest snow conditions in 2017. I&amp;rsquo;ll update these maps approximately every two weeks through the early summer.
The link to the most up-to-date forecast map is here. If you zoom in on the map enough, you should see overlayed data for roads and trails!
As of June 21st, 2017, I&amp;rsquo;m making the following projections for snow melt timing for key parts of Mt.</description>

      <title>MORAclim Climate Maps</title>

      <description>With support from the Northwest Climate Science Center, USGS Center for Integrated Data and Analytics, and the National Park Service, it’s my pleasure to introduce new gridded climate maps for Mt. Rainier National Park. These products are based on six years of monitoring air temperature and snow duration at hundreds of sites across Mt. Rainier using data from climate stations and low-cost distributed temperature sensors.
For the first time, MORAclim gives us a detailed picture of how the Mountain’s topography and vegetation interact with the regional climate to produce a diverse set of microclimates.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated by old photographs, so last year when I found an old panoramic photo of Mt. Rainier in Pat Pringle&amp;rsquo;s excellent Roadside Geology of Mount Rainier National Park and Vicinity I got really excited. The photo was taken in 1904 by W.P. Romans, and shows the northwest slopes of the mountain in the vicinity of Spray Park. The original is maintained by the Washington State Historical Society</description>
