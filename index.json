A Windows, Mac, or Linux computer with ~1GB free storage space is fine.\nSome software: You will need to install a few pieces of software for the interactive elements:\n Agisoft Photoscan Professional. We will use this to process the drone imagery into maps and 3d models. This program is not free, but you can use the free \u0026ldquo;demo mode” for all of the steps that we will take in the workshop. There is also a free 30-day trial option.\n QGIS, a free and open-source mapping/GIS program. We will use this to view and explore the maps we made with Photoscan. If you already have another GIS program like ArcGIS installed, that will work fine too.\n  Sample data: To follow along with the interactive sections, you will need to download files useful for flight planning as well as some sample imagery:\n Flight Planning Files\n Full Resolution Imagery (For Fast Computers)\n Reduced Resolution Imagery (For Slower Computers)\n  Workshop slides Here are the slides I used for the presentation.

This has brought me to Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Gothic Colorado, which is home to one of North America\u0026rsquo;s longest-running phenology monitoring programs.\nThe inspiration This project has been bouncing around in my head for a while: how can we see and understand the landscape like a pollinator does? The main obstacle is a mismatch between the spatial scales of the processes that we are interested in (pollinator foraging over large landscapes), and the data that we can actually collect (floral abundance and pollinator visitation in tiny plots or transects). If we could develop a way to monitor the timing and abundance of flowering efficiently over large extents, though, we might be able to piece together how the landscapes of floral resources for pollinators change over the course of the season, or even how longer-term trends like climate change are likely to alter these spatial patterns.\nThe barriers Before the development of modern quadcopter drones with high-resolution cameras, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t feasible to collect imagery data at a high enough resolution to see individual flowers at a large enough extent to say anything about landscape patterns. Essentially flowers are extremely small (2mm - 5cm), and the landscape is extremely large. Even with a 12 megapixel camera (standard on consumer drones until recently) we would have to fly extremely slowly at 5m above the ground to capture imagery with high enough ground resolution (3mm) to see most flowers. Luckily, over the past few years the technology has finally matured enough to make this more feasible: A drone with a 20 megapixel camera can fly at 10m and still capture 3mm imagery mosaics. Flight times of up to 30 minutes gives each flight a survey area of about 1 hectare.\nEven with good imagery, counting flowers by hand wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be feasible over large areas because there can be many tens of thousands of flowers in a hectare of meadow. This is where machine learning comes in. Flowers (or inflorescences) are discrete, compact objects with contrasting colors againsta soil or vegetation background. These objects are great candidates for being accurately counted using new computer vision tools called convolutional neural networks. I plan to use frameworks developed by Planet Labs and others to automate this classification task.\nGround-truthing Drones provide a great top-down view of ecosystems, but they can\u0026rsquo;t see through dense vegetation. How well can photo-based counts of flowers align with more traditional plot-based data? This is what has brought me to Colorado, where researchers have been collecting field data on wilflower phenology in a network of 30 plots since 1973! I\u0026rsquo;m coordinating with the project field lead Jane Ogilvie to make sure my drone imagery lines up with the timing of their field surveys. How well can we do? Time will tell.\nWish me luck!

Although a majority of species distributions are tracking climates shifting upslope and higher in latitude, the ranges of many species have failed to closely track climate, and range limits of some species have moved downhill or south, counter to the expected direction. The dominant factors driving these “counter-gradient” range shifts are unclear, but many have suggested that they reflect the imprint of ecological interactions, novel physiological responses, or past biogeographical events in defining contemporary range limits. Here we suggest that climate’s influence on disturbance regimes and metapopulation dynamics — broad scale patterns of colonization and persistence across networks of habitat patches — play an under-appreciated role in determining the response of species ranges to climate change, and may explain some of the diversity of climate-driven range-shifts observed in nature.\nTo make this case, we marshaled evidence from a field study of two ecologically similar riparian plant species (common yellow monkeyflower, Erythranthe guttata, and mountain monkeyflower, E. caespitosa) in Mt. Rainier National Park, WA, USA. We combined detailed demographic data collected from individuals growing in experimental populations across the range limits of both species with four years of comprehensive census data from wild populations. We then used this data to parameterize a spatial population model that incorporates the effects of climate and other habitat attributes on local demographic performance, as well as on colonization and local extinction processes. Simulating range dynamics at Mt. Rainier under a variety of climate change and disturbance scenarios, we found that both the magnitude and direction of predicted elevation range shifts differed dramatically between species and were extremely sensitive to changes in the disturbance regime. Increases in flood disturbance, predicted in the region by the late 21st century, caused the upper range limit of E. guttata, the low-elevation species, to move up in elevation twice as far as in a scenario assuming no change to the disturbance regime. Under current levels of flood disturbance, or if disturbance becomes less frequent, models projected downhill shifts in the low-elevation limit of E. caespitosa in scenarios assuming considerable warming. Overall, simulated range shifts were considerably more sensitive to climate impacts on colonization and disturbance processes than impacts on local demography for both species, indicating that neglecting these important processes might lead to misleading predictions about range shifts in response to changes in climate. Our results highlight the importance of interactions between climate, local demography, disturbance, and colonization processes in determining the response of species ranges to environmental change. We suspect that these interactions are important in many systems where populations are patchy near range limits, and that understanding their role will bolster efforts to forecast the impacts of climate change on species distributions.\n","date":1524812400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524812400,"objectID":"3e616611e2cdf17288567963b752a90a","permalink":"https://tinyplant.org/project/range-disturbance/","publishdate":"2018-04-27T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/range-disturbance/","section":"project","summary":"How are climate-driven range shifts altered by disturbance?","tags":["community"],"title":"Ranges and Disturbance","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"As climate change accelerates, it is critical for scientists and policymakers to understand how climate influences the links between ecosystems and their social context. Surprisingly, despite increased attention to coupled analyses of social-ecological systems, there have been few studies that simultaneously measure how changes in climate drive changes in the temporal distribution of natural resources and the people that use those resources.\nWe measured how climate influences the spatial and temporal match between human visitors and seasonal displays of subalpine wildflowers at Mt. Rainier National Park, where wildflower blooms are a key visitor draw. We use a large, field-validated dataset derived from the Flickr photo sharing service and volunteer citizen scientists to show that the phenological match between these ecological and social systems is sensitive to the date that seasonal snowpack disappears.\nEarly snow melts, comparable to conditions predicted in the late 21st century, cause reduced temporal overlap between wildflowers and park visitors (by 17.4 to 48.9 %). In-line with ecological and social theory, we expect social-ecological mismatches in phenology to be common in systems where users of natural resources (i.e. park visitors) have imperfect information about climatic drivers of their resource, and where seasonal shifts in their behavior is constrained by non-climatic factors.

This has led to concerns that important ecological interactions may be altered or lost as climate change continues to accelerate. Surprisingly, despite the potential importance of these 'phenological mismatches', much of the work on this topic ignores the fact that organisms in many environments are interacting in heterogeneous landscapes where the climatic drivers of phenology vary at many different spatial scales. This heterogeneity could potentially buffer interactions against mismatch, but how much this matters depends in part on the scaling relationships that link individual-scale and landscape-scale patterns of phenology. Here we report the first estimates of these spatial scaling relationships for plant reproduction. We derived these estimates from a long-term dataset of the flowering times of a diverse community of subalpine meadow plants in the Elk Mountains of Southwestern Colorado. We found that scaling relationships vary widely across species and years, suggesting that spatial heterogeneity is likely to buffer some interactions much more strongly than others.

Much like spatial community reassembly, temporal reassembly could be particularly important when critical species interactions are temporally concentrated (e.g., plant‐pollinator dynamics during flowering). Previous studies have documented species‐specific shifts in phenology driven by climate change, implying that temporal reassembly, a process we term “phenological reassembly,” is likely. However, few studies have documented changes in the temporal co‐occurrence of community members driven by environmental change, likely because few datasets of entire communities exist. We addressed this gap by quantifying the relationship between flowering phenology and climate for 48 co‐occurring subalpine wildflower species at Mount Rainier (Washington, USA) in a large network of plots distributed across Mt. Rainier's steep environmental gradients; large spatio‐temporal variability in climate over the 6 yr of our study (including the earliest and latest snowmelt year on record) provided robust estimates of climate‐phenology relationships for individual species. We used these relationships to examine changes to community co‐flowering composition driven by ‘climate change analog’ conditions experienced at our sites in 2015. We found that both the timing and duration of flowering of focal species was strongly sensitive to multiple climatic factors (snowmelt, temperature, and soil moisture). Some consistent responses emerged, including earlier snowmelt and warmer growing seasons driving flowering phenology earlier for all focal species. However, variation among species in their phenological sensitivities to these climate drivers was large enough that phenological reassembly occurred in the climate change analog conditions of 2015. An unexpected driver of phenological reassembly was fine‐scale variation in the direction and magnitude of climatic change, causing phenological reassembly to be most apparent early and late in the season and in topographic locations where snow duration was shortest (i.e., at low elevations and on ridges in the landscape). Because phenological reassembly may have implications for many types of ecological interactions, failing to monitor community‐level repercussions of species‐specific phenological shifts could underestimate climate change impacts.","tags":[],"title":"Climate drives phenological reassembly of a mountain wildflower meadow community","type":"publication"},{"authors":["NC Cristea","I Breckheimer","MS Raleigh","J HilleRisLambers","JD Lundquist"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1499929200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1499929200,"objectID":"a50df1049222d1a426786a20068e24af","permalink":"https://tinyplant.org/publication/snow-downscaling/","publishdate":"2017-07-13T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/snow-downscaling/","section":"publication","summary":"Reliable maps of snow‐covered areas at scales of meters to tens of meters, with daily temporal resolution, are essential to understanding snow heterogeneity, melt runoff, energy exchange, and ecological processes. Here we develop a parsimonious downscaling routine that can be applied to fractional snow covered area (fSCA) products from satellite platforms such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) that provide daily ∼500 m data, to derive higher‐resolution snow presence/absence grids. The method uses a composite index combining both the topographic position index (TPI) to represent accumulation effects and the diurnal anisotropic heat (DAH, sun exposure) index to represent ablation effects. The procedure is evaluated and calibrated using airborne‐derived high‐resolution data sets across the Tuolumne watershed, CA using 11 scenes in 2014 to downscale to 30 m resolution. The average matching F score was 0.83. We then tested our method's transferability in time and space by comparing against the Tuolumne watershed in water years 2013 and 2015, and over an entirely different site, Mt. Rainier, WA in 2009 and 2011, to assess applicability to other topographic and climatic conditions. For application to sites without validation data, we recommend equal weights for the TPI and DAH indices and close TPI neighborhoods (60 and 27 m for downscaling to 30 and 3 m, respectively), which worked well in both our study areas. The method is less effective in forested areas, which still requires site‐specific treatment. We demonstrate that the procedure can even be applied to downscale to 3 m resolution, a very fine scale relevant to alpine ecohydrology research.","tags":[],"title":"An evaluation of terrain‐based downscaling of fractional snow covered area data sets based on LiDAR‐derived snow data and orthoimagery","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":" I\u0026rsquo;ve updated my seasonal snow melt forecasts for Mt.

Snowpack melts later in years when more snow accumulates, so we can use that relationship to forecast the eventual date of melt at Paradise as long as we know how large the snowpack currently is.\n2. Microclimate Sensors. To extrapolate this forecast spatially, we use the relationship between when snow melted at the Paradise SNOTEL station and when it melted at a network of ~400 snow duration sensors distributed throughout the park during the previous 6 years. These sensors allow us to estimate how much topography, canopy cover, and geographic position affect when snow melts.\n3. Expert knowledge. The relationship between SNOTEL station melt dates and melt dates in other parts of the park varies from year to year, depending on the wind direction during winter storms and the average snow level during those storms. We use reports of snow from NPS crews, Washington DOT road closure reports, and information from other SNOTEL stations to select from the recent historical record the year where these patterns of snow accumulation most resemble the current year, and base our spatial forecasts on the spatial pattern of melt that most closely resembles the current year. We also adjust the forecast melt rates based on NOAA seasonal climate outlooks. If the outlook is for a warmer-than-average spring, then the forecast melt date is adjusted forward up to 10 days.\nHow much uncertainty is there in the forecast? That depends on when and where. The uncertainty is generally high early in the season, and decreases as the spring melt season progresses. Early-season forecasts have an average uncertainty (80% prediction interval) of plus-or-minus approximately 3 weeks, and that decreases to approximately plus-or-minus one week as snowpack at the Paradie SNOTEL station reaches 25% of it\u0026rsquo;s peak seasonal value. Uncertainty is also high in parts of Mt. Rainier National Park where we have few measurements, including remote areas and high elevations (above 7000\u0026rsquo;).\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s up with that mid-elevation snow? The early-season forecasts sometimes predict snow at mid-elevations (3000 - 4500ft) when there is no snowpack on the ground. This is because these elevations still are at risk of a late-spring snowstorm, and the forecast is for the last date of snow cover, not the melt date of persistent snowpack. At higher elevations at Mt. Rainier (above 4500ft) these two things are usually the same, but they differ at lower elevations where snow is not as persistant.\nWho put this forecast together? The forecast was created by Ian Breckheimer and Janneke Hille Ris Lambers at the University of Washington, based on initial work done by Kevin Ford, now at the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station. Groundwork for the forecast was funded by NASA and in-kind support from the NW Climate Science Center and the National Park Service.\n","date":1498028400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498892400,"objectID":"30ce5de12a7bfe33237accbfd6c0dfcf","permalink":"https://tinyplant.org/post/2017-06-01-snowmelt-forecasts/","publishdate":"2017-06-21T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-06-01-snowmelt-forecasts/","section":"post","summary":"Seasonal forecasts of snow disappearance for Mt.

Using replicated transect samples collected over a 10‐year interval from 2002 to 2012, we find evidence for concerted movement of genetic clines in a plateau fence lizard hybrid zone (Sceloporus tristichus) in Arizona. Cline‐fitting analyses of SNP and mtDNA data both provide evidence that the hybrid zone shifted northward by approximately 2 km during the 10‐year interval. For each sampling period, the mtDNA cline centre is displaced from the SNP cline centre and maintaining an introgression distance of approximately 3 km. The northward expansion of juniper trees into the Little Colorado River Basin in the early 1900s provides a plausible mechanism for hybrid zone formation and movement, and a broadscale quantification of recent land cover change provides support for increased woody species encroachment at the southern end of the hybrid zone. However, population processes can also contribute to hybrid zone movement, and the current stability of the ecotone habitats in the centre of the hybrid zone suggests that movement could decelerate in the future.","tags":[],"title":"Evidence for concerted movement of nuclear and mitochondrial clines in a lizard hybrid zone","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":" With support from the Northwest Climate Science Center, USGS Center for Integrated Data and Analytics, and the National Park Service, it’s my pleasure to introduce new gridded climate maps for Mt. Rainier National Park. These products are based on six years of monitoring air temperature and snow duration at hundreds of sites across Mt. Rainier using data from climate stations and low-cost distributed temperature sensors.\nFor the first time, MORAclim gives us a detailed picture of how the Mountain’s topography and vegetation interact with the regional climate to produce a diverse set of microclimates. This important baseline information will be used to inform research on how climate shapes Mt. Rainier’s forests, meadows, rivers, and glaciers as well as how climate change will impact these important resources. This post provides an overview of the MORAclim products, how they were developed, and what their appropriate uses and limitations are.\n** Summary products have been released in draft form, and can be downloaded here.**\n** Maps of selected products can be explored here.**\nWhy produce new climate maps for Mt. Rainier? When I started my dissertation work at Mt. Rainier National Park in 2012, I started to look at how climate measurements from my lab’s field sites lined up with the existing best-in-class gridded climate products. What I found was striking: the existing, relatively coarse-scale maps from PRISM and other sources didn’t match my ground-based measurements of air temperature very well at all. In some cases these products had seasonal biases of up to 4 degrees C! Because my research involves how climate affects plant populations and geographic distributions, these biases pose large problems for me and other researchers who are trying to forecast the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and other park resources.\nThe root cause of the problems in the existing climate maps are not a mystery: it takes a dense network of well-maintained climate stations to represent climate in complex terrain like the Cascades, and climate stations in the region are relatively few and far between. Furthermore, traditional weather stations are located in environments where the equipment is relatively easy to access and maintain. This means that most of these stations are located in open fields near roads and other infrastructure. This is a particular challenge at Mt. Rainier National Park, where the rugged topography and dense forests cause local climates to diverge from regional conditions in sometimes striking ways.\nIn 2015, I was lucky to receive funding from the Northwest Climate Science Center to address the problems I identified and develop a new set of climate products which I came to call “MORAclim”.\nMORAclim Methodology The data The base data that I used to build the MORAclim products are measurements from a network of air temperature and snow duration sensors installed and maintained by the HilleRisLambers lab at the University of Washington. This station network, initiated in 2008, has grown to more than 100 sites for air temperature, and more than 400 sites for snow duration (see Ford et al. 2013 for an early description of the station network). Air temperature at each station was measured every two hours at a height of 4-5m above the ground surface (above the typical level of the winter snowpack at Mt. Rainier) using low-cost data logging temperature sensors. These sensors were suspended from conifer tree branches under inverted white plastic funnels, with both the funnel and surrounding vegetation serving as radiation shields. Snow duration was measured using similar sensors attached to the soil surface. We also incorporated data from traditional weather stations in the vicinity of Mt. Rainier operated by the National Park Service, National Weather Service, USDA SNOTEL program, and the Northwest Avalanche Center. Data from each station and sensor was subject to a rigorous quality control algorithm, and quality-controlled measurements were used to compute daily average, minimum, and maximum temperatures for each station.\nLocations of sensors used to build MORAclim.\nModeling Approach Using the daily observations from weather stations and distributed sensors as base data, I extrapolated air temperature measurements across Mt. Rainier National Park using a statistical model. My approach breaks the daily measurements down into two parts: a deterministic component that varies predictably by season, and a stochastic component that varies daily, but has a overall long-term mean of zero. We used a relatively complex model for the deterministic component (which we fit only once for every season) and a relatively simple model for the stochastic component, which we need to fit for every day from September 1st 2009 to August 31st 2015. Estimating and mapping these two parts separately allowed me to account for the diverse sources of variation in microclimate at Mt. Rainier while reducing the errors associated with overfitting sparse data.\nIn the first stage of the analysis, we estimated the mean linear relationship between quality-controlled measurements at each station in our sensor network and a series of daily regional average conditions extracted from PRISM. We estimated two components of this local-regional relationship for each sensor in each of four seasons:\n The linear regression intercept, which indicates relatively how warm or cold a local site is relative to the region under typical conditions and\n The linear regression slope, which indicates how sensitive microclimates at a given site are to changes in regional conditions.\n  Local-regional regressions for two representative sites.\nI found that both of these components of the local-regional relationship were highly predictable based on the characteristics of the site. Stations at high elevations were predictably cooler than stations at lower elevations, for example, and west-slope locations were predictably less sensitive to regional temperature changes than east-slope locations. In fact, we found that between 75 and 95% of the variation in these relationships could be accounted for by factors such as elevation, canopy volume, insolation and relative slope position. Based on these relationships, we used generalized additive models to predict local-regional slopes and intercepts for each location at Mt. Rainier National Park for each season: Winter (December—February), Spring (March – May), Summer (June – August), and Fall (September – November), and from there produced an expected value for each location on each day based on the season, site attributes, and the regional average conditions for that day.\nIn the second stage of the analysis, we used a geostatistical approach called Bayesian Kriging to predict departures from expected conditions for each day, often referred to as “anomalies”. These anomalies are caused by local factors such as cloud cover, precipitation, or cold-air pooling. There are lots of different ways to extrapolate these kinds of local adjustments across space, but we selected a relatively new method called Bayesian Kriging for this analysis. This method has the advantage of being able to include covariates such as elevation as well as specify “prior information” in the model that causes estimates to be more robust on days where we have relatively few measurements.\nValidation No model gives perfect predictions, and any complex analysis involves many subjective decisions that can introduce bias into prediction and inference. To assess how well MORAclim performs, we compared our model’s predictions to measurements from 20 randomly-selected climate stations that we deliberately excluded from the analysis. We found that the MORAclim products perform well, with substantially reduced error and minimal bias compared with the data products that are currently available. Seasonal mean estimates of minimum and average temperatures have average absolute errors of less than 1 degree C for all seasons, while daily maximums had absolute errors between 1 and 1.5 degrees C. These statistics compare favorably to other recent efforts to model microclimates in mountainous locations, and are a substantial improvement over national state-of-the-art products PRISM and TopoWX.\nObserved vs. predicted values for seasonal and annual temperature means.\nThe Products MORAclim version 0.9 consists of four different types of climate products, each of which has it’s own strengths and limitations. All products are delivered as georeferenced raster images with NAD83 Datum, UTM Zone 10N projection, and 90m grid resolution.\nAir temperature summaries This dataset consists of statistical summaries of daily average air temperature, daily minimum air temperature, and daily maximum air temperature for each season (Winter-DJF, Spring-MAM, Summer-JJA, and Fall-SON) and annually, over the period of the study (September 1st 2009 – September 1st 2015). Summaries include the mean, standard deviation, upper and lower quartiles, and temperature extremes (5th and 95th quantiles). The extent of the data includes all of the main parcel of Mt. Rainier National Park and extends 90m beyond the park boundary.\nLimitations—Coverage of air temperature sensors is limited above 2000m, and nonexistent above 3300m, so there is relatively high uncertainty about conditions near the summit of Mt. Rainier. Furthermore, MORAclim estimates of extreme temperatures are inherently less certain than estimates for means, but this error is difficult to quantify.\nSnow cover summaries This dataset consists of gridded estimates of snow duration and last snow date during water years 2010 to 2015. This dataset represents a simple geostatistical prediction of snow cover probability for each day based on measurements at ~430 snow duration sensors distributed throughout Mt. Rainier National Park. This analysis uses GIS-based topographic and vegetation structure covariates to improve the predictions.\nLimitations—Coverage of snow duration sensors is limited above 1900m and is nonexistent above 2200m elevation, so there is high uncertainty about snow cover duration, first and last snow dates at high elevations. Snow duration sensors were not placed on cliffs or rock outcrops, so snow duration is likely overestimated for these topographic features that shed snow.\nGrowing and freezing degree-day summaries This dataset consists of gridded estimates of average cumulative degree-days and snow-free cumulative degree-days (temperature sums) during the growing season (April 1 – November 1) for 2009 – 2015. A base temperature of 5 degrees C was used for growing degree days. Freezing degree-day summaries are calculated in a similar fashion, with sums accumulating if daily minimum temperatures drop below 0C. The snow-free growing-degree and freezing-degree day products are generated by muliplying the daily temperature sum by the probability that each location was not covered by snow (i.e. air temperature sums accumulate half as quickly for days where the probability of snow cover is 0.5, and do not accumulate if the probability of snow cover is 1).\nLimitations—Growing-degree and freezing-degree day calculations are dependent on daily temperature and snow cover time-series that were estimated using air temperature and snow duration data from stations between 500 and 3300m elevation. Extrapolation errors are likely to be high at high elevations. Snow duration sensors were not placed on cliffs or rock outcrops, so snow duration is likely overestimated for these topographic features that shed snow.\nFirst and last freeze date summaries This dataset consists of gridded estimates of the average dates last frost from 2009 to 2015 and average dates of first frost from 2009 to 2014. Dates are recorded as day-of-year. First frost dates were not calculated for fall of 2015 because the temperature data only runs through August 30th, 2015. Frost dates are the first or last days of the calendar year where daily mimimum air temperatures (measured 4-5m above the ground) fall below 0 degrees C.\nLimitations—First and last frost dates were directly calculated from daily temperature time-series, and share all of the limitations of those products, particularly a lack of data above 3300m elevation. Extrapolation errors are likely to be high at higher elevations.\nThe road ahead MORAclim is a draft product released to the public and the community for testing and evaluation. It should not be used for mission-critical scientific or other work at this point. After an initial round of review (and manuscript submission), these products will be finalized, along with the daily time-series that were used to build the summary products. These data are too large to host here, but will eventually find their way to the Center for Integrated Data Analytics at USGS.\nIf you identify any problems, or would like to use these products in an ongoing project, drop me a line at ian_breckheimer@fas.harvard.edu.\n","date":1469170800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1469862000,"objectID":"7351e9dda7832d40c1d544bf2ebd5ff0","permalink":"https://tinyplant.org/post/2016-07-21-moraclim-intro/","publishdate":"2016-07-22T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/2016-07-21-moraclim-intro/","section":"post","summary":"Introducing MORAclim: state-of-the-art climate maps for Mt.

Rainier in Pat Pringle\u0026rsquo;s excellent Roadside Geology of Mount Rainier National Park and Vicinity I got really excited. The photo was taken in 1904 by W.P. Romans, and shows the northwest slopes of the mountain in the vicinity of Spray Park. The original is maintained by the Washington State Historical Society\nHow much has this place changed in 110 years? The Pacific Northwest has warmed about 0.8C since the photo was taken, and we have quite a few lines of evidence from photographs and montoring that most of the Park\u0026rsquo;s glaciers have been in retreat. Unfortunately, we don\u0026rsquo;t have as much information about how alpine and sub-alpine ecosystems have responded. Has the treeline crept upwards over the last century?\nLast summer, I set out to take a repeat photograph of Spray Park. First, I had to figure out where on earth WP Romans was standing. Google Earth was an invaluable tool for figuring this out, especially when I found out how to adjust the virtual camera\u0026rsquo;s field of view. Here\u0026rsquo;s my best shot at a re-creation of the photo using Google Earth.\nTurns out Romans must have been standing near the summit of Mt. Pleasant, 46.927667N, -121.838111W. After downloading the point into my GPS at the beginning of last summer, I didn\u0026rsquo;t think about it until September, when I was doing some field work in Spray Park that ended early, and there was just enough daylight left to grab the photo and get back to camp at Mowich Lake before dark.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not a perfect re-creation. The original photo wasn\u0026rsquo;t dated, so the two photographs probably are not taken at exactly the same time of year. Judging from the shadows, I probably arrived a bit later in the day than Romans did as well.\nRegardless, comparing the two photos is a lot of fun. I recommend you zoom in on the page a bit to help in the comparison.\n My take is that the tree clumps along ridges have thickened considerably, but there\u0026rsquo;s not much recruitment of trees into the subalpine meadows between them.
