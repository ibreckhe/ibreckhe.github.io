# Part 1: What can drones do now?

## Why drones, why now?

> - Scaling from plots to landscapes
> - Bridging the gap between field measurements and sattelite remote-sensing
> - Seeing the invisible: Beyond visible wavelengths
> - Counting the uncountable: Computer vision
> - The technology is getting (relatively) cheap and robust

# Part 2: Study Design 

## How do you design a drone study?

*Sampling the Landscape:* Three general designs

<div class="centered">
<img src="./images/sampling.png" width="750px" />
</div>

## How large an area can you survey?

> *Survey Area* - f(Ground Resolution, Sensor, Flight Time)

> Quadcopter DJI Phantom 4 Pro (20 Mpix RGB Camera): 

> - 2 mm ground resolution, 
	10m height: *~1 ha per flight*
	  
> - 3cm ground resolution, 
	120m height: *~40 ha per flight*
	
> Fixed-wing Firefly6 Pro (40 Mpix RGB Camera):

> - 3cm ground resolution, 
	120m height *~200 ha per flight*

## Other constraints

> - Maintain Visual Line-of-sight: DJI Phantom - ~500m

> - Max altitude: 400 feet (~120m) AGL

## Design your own study.

> Brainstorm a study design (10 min)

> Then share and refine it with a team of two (10 min)

## Helpful Queries:

- What are the scientific questions?

- What measurements are necessary?

- What UAV-based sensors might you use?

- What ground resolution do you need?

- Survey design: Wall-to-wall? Plots? Transects?

- Platform Type: Quadcopter? Fixed-wing?

- What would be the overall hardware cost?

# Part 3: Preparing to Fly

## OK, Let's (prepare to) Fly!

Goal: Build a 3D model of the Townsite.

Requirements:

- ~3cm ground resolution

- > 66% overlap between images

## Flight Planning Demo:

- R Script Demo

- Litchi Mission Hub Demo

## Let's Fly!

Meet behind the Natural History Building in 5 minutes.

# Part 4: From Images to Maps and Models

## Basic photogrammetry concepts

Photogrammetry - Making (correct) Measurements from Photographs

<div class="centered">
<img src="./images/orthophotoscope.png" width="750px" />
</div>

## Orthorectification

Undistorting photos to get a true "top-down view"

<div class="centered">
<img src="./images/orthorectification.png" width="750px" />
</div>

Orthorectified Photo = Orthophoto

## Structure from Motion (SfM)

Reconstructing 3D Scenes from collections of 2D Images

<div class="centered">
<img src="./images/SFM.png" width="600px" />
</div>

Under the hood:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform

##Photogrammetry Software

> - Proprietary: Agisoft Photoscan, Pix4D

> - Open-source: Regard3D

> - Cloud-based processing: DroneDeploy

> - GIS Software: QGIS, ArcGIS

## Why Proprietary Software?

> - Patented algorithms for components of SfM

> - Good interfaces for 3D modeling are hard to build.

> - Agisoft Photoscan - Fast, Stable, Easy to Use, *Relatively* Cheap

## On your own

Follow the preparation steps (up to Stage 1) in the [tutorial from NCSU](https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/uav-lidar-analytics-course/assignments/geoprocessing.html)

Add photos from the data folder using Workflow -> Add Photos...

## Agisoft Photoscan Interface Tour

## On your own

Follow the steps in Stage 1 of the [tutorial from NCSU](https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/uav-lidar-analytics-course/assignments/geoprocessing.html) in order to Align the Photos.

## While we are waiting: Ground-control Points

- Located in the field with a high-accuracy GPS.
- Improves geometric accuracy of resulting maps.
- At least 3, ideally 7 - 10 per flight

<div class="centered">
<img src="./images/GCP_Placement.jpg" width="600px" />
</div>

## On your own

Follow the steps in Stage 2 of the [tutorial from NCSU](https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/uav-lidar-analytics-course/assignments/geoprocessing.html) in order to locate the GCPs in photos.

Then follow the steps in stage three through the step 
Menu > Workflow > Build Dense Cloud. This will take a while to process.

## While we are waiting: UAV Regulatory Environments

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considers drones to be aircraft

- Flying for research: considered commercial use, requires [remote pilot certification](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/part_107/remote_pilot_cert/)

### Key Regulations
- Airspace restrictions - near Airports & Military Bases

- Temporary flight restrictions - Air Force One, Fire Fighting, etc.

- Line-of-sight, visibility, and wind requirements.
	
## Land Management Agency Requirements: 

- NPS - No drones at all except in a few parks

- USFS, BLM - Must get a special use permit

- Designated Wilderness - No drones

- State Parks - Varies by state and park.

## RMBL Requirements:

- 10m from roads, trails and people

- Comply with FAA regulations

- Minimize conflict with other researchers

- Coordinate with science director Jennie Riethel
	
## On your own

Follow the steps in Stage 3 of the [tutorial from NCSU](https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/uav-lidar-analytics-course/assignments/geoprocessing.html) in order to build the 3D Mesh and Texture.

## Safety & Consideration

- Programmed Flights - avoid trees by >4m, pay attention to overhead wires

- Low-elevation flights (<20m) - ground-following flights using a high-res DEM

- Private property - DroneHunter, Assumption of Surveillance

- Be conspicuous and friendly, take time to explain the purpose of the flights

## Computing Hardware and Storage

- GPU vs CPU Performance
	
- 300 minutes of flight time / week = 120GB / Week of Imagery
	
- Processing in the cloud - [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/core) virtual servers.

## Burning questions

Did we cover everything?

## Extending your knowledge.
